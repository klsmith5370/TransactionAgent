## Project Overview and Goals

Objective: Create a team of AI agents that work collaboratively to handle credit card transactions. The agents will perform tasks such as transaction authorization, fraud detection, and generating transaction summaries.

## Goals:

Transaction Authorization: Verify the validity of the credit card details and the availability of funds.

Fraud Detection: Identify potential fraudulent transactions using machine learning models.

Transaction Summary Generation: Create summaries of transactions and notify users.

## Frameworks and APIs

LangGraph Framework: This will be used to design and build the workflow of the AI agents.
Tavily API: This will be used to enhance the agents' reliability and incorporate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Agents and Their Roles
Authorization Agent:

Task: Authorize credit card transactions.
Process: Verify card details, check available funds, and approve or decline the transaction.
Fraud Detection Agent:

Task: Detect potential fraudulent transactions.
Process: Use a pre-trained machine learning model to analyze transaction data and flag suspicious activities.

Summary Generation Agent:

Task: Generate transaction summaries.
Process: Create a concise summary of each transaction and notify the user.

## Set Up the Project:

Create a new GitHub repository.
Initialize the project with necessary files and dependencies.

Integrate LangGraph Framework:

Design the workflow for the AI agents using LangGraph.
Define the tasks and interactions between the agents.
Implement the Authorization Agent:

Write the logic for verifying card details and checking funds.
Use the Tavily API for reliability and data augmentation.
Implement the Fraud Detection Agent:

Integrate a pre-trained fraud detection model.
Use the Tavily API for data retrieval and analysis.
Implement the Summary Generation Agent:

Create functions to generate transaction summaries.
Use the Tavily API for generating user-friendly summaries.

## Testing and Deployment:

Test the agents individually and as a team.
Ensure seamless collaboration between agents.
Deploy the project and publish it on GitHub.
